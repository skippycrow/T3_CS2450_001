* Python version `3.7.12`
  * If you have another version istalled on the system, you can use a tool like `pyenv` to install and manage multiple python versions
  * Needs to have `tkinter` enabled, `csv` will also be used
    * currently, no additional packages will need to be installed via `pip`, though you can use the `thonny` IDE as recommended
  * follow PEP-8 style guides as closely as feasable

* do not push directly to `main` branch; create separate branch for your feature/bugfix, push to that, and submit a PR
  * this will help reduce conflicts, and enable others to review changes
  
* (naming guidelines for issues/PRs?)

* use UTF-8 encoding on all text files
